# Decisions/assumptions log
1. Ignore FPT region for now.
2. This metric wont work for non-dare projects but thats ok cause they are single region
3. What do we log when dare region is not found?


# Approach
Identify the DaRe region and current ERSS region, compare and append as tags to SLO
** Pull DaRe region from TCS (I believe XIS already does this)
** Use POC branch to support additional metrics to SLO
Append the following tags: crossRegion=True/False, ESSRegion=us-west2, DaReRegion=us-east2

## Brainstorm

## SubTasks
[x] Confirm approach with Luke
[ ] Copy DaRe region lookup from XIS (tcs/entity/cloud/${cloudId}-xis)
[ ] Get ESS region using MICROS_AWS_REGION
[ ] Write functionality that compares current ESS region to DaRe region and produce tags

[ ] Identify SLO metrics
[ ] Finish work for POC branch (tests/increment version/readme/changelog)
